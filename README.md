## Usage

Head over to `server` folder, and run `npm i`. After that, run `npx nodemon app` to start the server. More information about how the API works is in the `README.md` inside the same folder.

Then, head over to `client` folder, and do the same steps as the `server` folder.

And finally, open `http://localhost:3457` in the browser to start the app in action.
